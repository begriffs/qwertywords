### Words that are fun to type

Outputs the words which are convenient to type in qwerty:

```
./qwertywords < /usr/share/dict/words
```

Useful for generating usernames, domain names, etc, where you want to
perpetuate the monstrous effects of this distorted key layout.

### What makes them fun to type?

They alternate letters between hands rather than making a solo hand jump
around. If one hand must strike two keys in a row, they are chosen to be ones
that roll off the fingers like po, oi, iu, lk, as, we, er.
